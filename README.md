## Aim:Encouraging reuse of stuff
## Why is reuse better than recycle?
### The waste hierarchy
The Waste Hierarchy sets out a hierarchy of options for managing waste in terms of what is best for the environment. The different options (in order of preference) are illustrated below:

Consider a mobile phone - all the work that has gone into making it (forming, shaping, component assembly etc.) is lost when the phone is recycled where the base plastic and metals will be recovered. If the phone is reused maximum value is retained (energy and resources). Another example is recycling plastic, typically the recycling process degrades the quality of a plastic as it is mixed with slightly different plastics, qualities and/or colours. Often, plastic becomes unrecyclable after one or two loops e.g. mushroom plastic trays are typically not recyclable.

### Why do we need more reuse?
There is 26.8 million tonnes of waste generated by households in the UK each year (2014). Of this 45% was recycled, leaving 14.8 million tonnes of waste to landfill - a quarter of a tonne per person! As we learnt above, even 100% recycling is only a stepping stone to being environmentally friendly. Moving to an increased world of reuse and not just recycling is key to reduce the waste generated and thus burden on the planet.

### Who: Anyone looking to give stuff they no longer need or get stuff they  
### How: by connecting people who want to give stuff away (Givers) to those who want that stuff (Getters) 
### What: Ultimately an app that displays a mosaic of photos of things that Givers want to give away for Getters to take. The app would be geo-located meaning photos are tiled either chronologically or by distance. 
Clicking on photos would reveal further information and an ability to message to Giver.

#### A picture is worth a thousand words... 
Freecycle is a network that pursues the same aims. However, the way it is structured means that users often have to sign up to several different communities and most objects do not have photos making it very difficult to judge for Getters whether the item is desirable or not. This lack of certainty can discourage potential Getters to becoming actual Getters. This idea helps people get over this barrier and brings an updated / more modern user interface.
